### Game Mechanics

In Hangman, you have to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

### Rules

The game chooses a random word from a predefined list.
The player must guess letters one at a time to try and reveal the hidden word.
For each incorrect guess, the player loses a life.
The game continues until the player either guesses the word or loses all lives.

### Components
Word List: The game features a list of words from which a random word is selected for each game.
Lives: Players start with 6 lives, losing one for each incorrect guess.
ASCII Art: The hangman and other fun graphics that change as the player makes incorrect guesses.

### How to Play
Run the game in your terminal.
You will be given a random word represented by blanks (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _").
You can guess one letter at a time.
The game will inform you if the letter is in the word or not.
If you guess all the letters before losing all your lives, you win! If not, it's game over.

### Example Gameplay
